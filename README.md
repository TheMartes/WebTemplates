# HTML Theme Templates by TheMartes
**Are you tired of writing front-end templates for your websites?**<br />
**Are you a back-end developer, and you don't like HTML & CSS much?**

If you said "yes" for both questions, then this repository is right for you. You should visit [Themes preview page](https://themes.themartes.com) for a preview of all themes. Themes are made to work with all modern browsers, but also IE11+ is supported.  

#### Themes are made in plain HTML & CSS without any compilers or JavaScript.

# Installation
Just clone this repository, and select the folder with theme you want to use. Themes are ready to implement after downloading. Every file and picture are stored locally to the sites, so if you work at your local machine without the internet connection, templates should be working.

Or you can go to [themes preview page](https://themes.themartes.com), and download only that theme, you want to use.

#### Structure
Structure of folders in themes are same in any theme.
```
 |ROOT
 |
 |--css
 |   |
 |   -- // There are all css files, what you will need to show theme correctly
 |
 |--img
 |   |
 |   -- // This folder contains all images what are used in theme
 |
 |--*.html // .html files are the core of every theme. Just make sure that you've them all.
```

#### Contribute
If you want so submit your design, and make it public for all, just create an issue with prefix `*NewTheme`, and add a link to your files. Currently, I only accept .ps, .ai, or .xd files. Your credentials will be mentioned in footer of your theme.

If you like this project, please consider to buy me a beer for time, I've spent on this themes. My PayPal address is **matt.buncek@gmail.com**. Thanks a lot!

### **Enjoy your new theme :)**
